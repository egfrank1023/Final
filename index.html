					The COVID-19 pandemic has strained people, places, businesses, and the entire world. The coronavirus has caused immeasurable stress and anxiety on a variety of people and their lives. One of the most high-profile and clearest examples of that was restaurants. 
				</p>

				<p>
					The simplicity of heading to a restaurant, talking to the host or hostess, being seated at your table, enjoying a meal, paying the check, and leaving is not so simple anymore. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Rules and regulations are different all over the country, but that does not mean thousands of people’s lives have changed because of the pandemic and the impact COVID-19 has had on the restaurant industry.  
				</p>

				<p>
					Specifically, the federal government has used the Small Business Administration to give payroll protection program (PPP) funds for restaurants around the United States. These grants went to places around the US, and some restaurants got more than others. Specifically in Syracuse, New York, the numbers paint a clear picture.

					As seen in the chart on the left, more than 60 Syracuse area restaurants were able to receive federal funding from the Restaurant Revitalization Fund.  
				</p>

				<p>
					Dinosaur Barbeque is a place people know of far and wide. They have expanded around New York state because of their popularity.  
				</p>

				<p>
					The purpose of the fund was to provide companies with stability after the severe losses many businesses suffered from the pandemic. Specifically for Dinosaur Barbeque, the grant from the SBA has made a major impact, Lisa Braddock, Chief Financial Officer of Dinosaur Restaurants, LLC, said.
				</p>

				<p>
					“The RRF grant has been essential to our operations in all the locations,” Braddock said.

					Syracuse is just one city in New York where restaurants struggled during the pandemic. New York City has arguably the most restrictive coronavirus guidelines in the entire country.
				</p>

				<p>
					David Hess, a co-founder of Bondi sushi in Manhattan, said despite New York City’s regulations the company was able to use enhanced delivery options and a strong consumer base to not fire any employees, and stay open during the heart of the pandemic.
				</p>

				<p>
					“Some of the businesses like ours that were more fast-casual and had a significant delivery business actually did pretty well,” Hess explained. “We had five stores operating at the time and didn’t have to fire any of our employees.”
				</p>

				<p>
					Adapting to the current times and using what was available to the business was instrumental to the success of restaurants for the past 20 months. Bondi emphasized delivery and strong customer service, Hess said. Other places used different strategies. But some did not have any strategy at all.

					The restaurant revitalization fund was used to assist places like Dinosaur Barbeque, but Hess and Bondi did not receive anything from that specific fund. The same goes for JuiceLand, a smoothie company based out of Austin, Texas.
				</p>

				<p>
					JuiceLand has operations all over Texas, and that was part of the reason that they were ineligible from the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, CFO Maurine Winkley said.
				</p>

				<p>
					“We were not able to use the Restaurant Revitalization Fund because we have more than 20 locations,” Winkley explained.
				</p>

				<p>
					Despite not getting as much funding as they hoped, Winkley said that JuiceLand was still able to take a lot away from their experiences during COVID-19 to use in the future. The restaurant business has undergone major changes in the past year, but one thing remains true, Winkley said.
				</p>

				<p>
					“People want to be in the presence of other people,” Winkley said.

					The Small Business Administration has been busy for the past 20 months. The federal government decided the most effective way to get money back to these businesses from the revenue they lost because of pandemic-induced shutdowns was through these grants. PPP money went almost everywhere, and almost every company received funding in the first round of giving, Hess said.
				</p>

				<p>
					However, not every business is treated equally in terms of capacity in-house, because every state still has different restrictions in place for consumers. Texas and New York have entirely different rules for their customers about entering and eating in restaurants.
				</p>

				<p>
					Bondi is available to significantly fewer people, considering the unvaccinated cannot dine in New York City and there is still 30% of people who have not had two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
				</p>

				<p>
					However, Bondi created a strategy that was easy to follow and chart how much of the business they were losing from unvaccinated customers.
				</p>

				<p>
					“We are making our employees write down on a log whenever they were turning away a customer whenever they were not vaccinated,” Hess explained. “I wanted to get an idea for how much business we were losing and it was pretty small.”
				</p>

				<p>
					Even if there are some unvaccinated customers of Bondi within New York City, they still have the option to order delivery and take advantage of that option despite not being able to dine in the restaurant, Hess said.
				</p>

				<p>
					“Whatever the drop-off is on the dine-in side, I bet we’re making it up on the delivery service,” Hess said.”
				</p>

				<p>
					Comparatively in Texas, mask mandates have been banned by Gov. Greg Abbott, and restrictions are much looser than in other parts of the country.
				</p>

				<p>
					“From an economic perspective, I’m grateful to be in Texas,” Winkley said. “I can’t imagine what some other businesses were going through having severely limited operations. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Yet, when both need funding to survive a pandemic, they have to go to the same place despite existing under different circumstances. For Bondi, the price of staying open and keeping all employees on board during the peak of the pandemic might have cost them in receiving federal government loans.
				</p>

				<p>
					“The people that actually made the most money were the people who shut [down],” Hess said. “For the Restaurant Revitalization Act, the basic math of it is your 2019 sales minus your 2020 sales. The government gave you a check in cash for whatever that difference is.”

				</p>

				<p>
					Therefore, if a business was making $5 million in sales pre-COVID, and that business could not open for any reason during the peak of the pandemic, the government, through the SBA would give that business a check for $5 million, Hess explained.

				</p>
				
				<p>
					The Small Business Administration had never been used like this before. The numbers are staggering for how much the SBA was putting into companies around the country.

				<p>
					Before 2010, the Small Business Administration had never spent more than $4 billion in a year. There was not a global pandemic that would cause the federal government to need to stimulate millions of businesses around the country, but that is still a staggering number to see one specific White House agency increase its outlays by over $500 billion in two years.
				</p>

				<p>
					Therefore, arguably no industry has been hit harder in terms of having to change its business model to survive than the restaurant industry. Restaurants had to work with the government and banks to help keep themselves afloat and fight to stay in business. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Not just that, but doing right by the employees of the company was important to many business owners, who knew the hardships of the job market at the moment.
				</p>

				<p>
					“We’ve seen what's done to this city when you shut down every restaurant in New York,” Hess said. “Most of these businesses are just closing. How many more rounds of government aid can we do?”
